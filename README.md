# SC1015-DSAI-B128-Team-9

## About

Our project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) analyses pokemon 

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if a movie is good (rating above 7.2) based on its attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression

## Conclusion

- Popularity and budget have low linear correlation value with ratings (watch out for bandwagons ðŸ¤£)
- Popularity of the casts and crews have higher linear correlation value with ratings
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
- Neural Networks along with SMOTEENN resampling method consistently did well in predicting good movies after 100 training attempts (around 72% accuracy, 70% recall)
- Yes, it is possible to predict if a movie is good with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall

## What did we learn from this project?

- Collaborating using Google Colab
- How One Hot and Label Encoding work and when should they be applied
- Lambda functions to group different categorical values as one
- How Random Forest Regression and GridSearchCV work
